    <h1>About the Bair Family Property</h1>
    <p>
      Once known as <strong>Devil's Den</strong>, this land in Perry Township, Tuscarawas County, Ohio, is steeped in rich history. Its striking geological features — including a 60-foot waterfall, rock formations, caves, and a spring-fed lake — have drawn attention since the 1770s. Native American tribes frequented the area, and in later years, it became a beloved spot for tourists and picnickers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1958, Steve Storad developed it into Devil's Den Park, which provided camping, swimming, and hiking opportunities. In the 1980s, the site gained further notoriety when it became a nudist resort, <em>Whispering Winds</em>, hosting national conventions. Today, the property is under private ownership and closed to the public, but its natural beauty and lore endure.
